![Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Welcome to the 2D Space Shooter game repository! This project is a space shooter game created by me using the Godot 4 engine. It's a work-in-progress, and I followed a fantastic tutorial provided by [KidsCanCode](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/games/first_2d/index.html) to build the foundation of this game.

## How to Play
* To play the game, you can either download the executable from the releases section or build it from the source code using Godot 4.
* Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship in different directions.
* Press the spacebar to shoot lasers at the enemies and destroy them.
* Be careful to avoid the enemy's attacks and stay alive as long as you can!

## Future Updates
I'm actively working on improving and expanding this game. As I learn more about Godot 4 and explore its capabilities, I plan to add the following features:

* **Power-ups**: Collect power-ups to upgrade your spaceship's abilities and weapons.
* **Multiple Levels**: Experience different challenges and enemies as you progress through various levels.
* **Boss Fights**: Prepare for epic battles against powerful boss enemies.
* **Sound Effects and Music**: Enhance the game's atmosphere with immersive sound effects and background music.
* **Visual Improvements**: Polish the graphics and animations to make the game visually appealing.
* **High Scores**: Implement a high-score system to compete with your friends and other players.

Stay tuned for updates as I make progress on these exciting features!
